# 1) Ensure commitlint is installed (npm i -D @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli).
# 2) Make sure this file is executable (chmod +x .githooks/commit-msg).
# 3) Configure Git to use .githooks as the hook path (see next step).

# "$1" is the path to the file containing the commit message.
